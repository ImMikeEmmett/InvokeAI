# InvokeAI
### A Google Colab / InvokeAI project <br>
This is a tool to use Google colab (https://colab.research.google.com) to run the AI image generation tool: Invokeai (https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/). <br>
This automatically builds itself and can import custom models, It can use to Google drive to save your images. <br>
It also has the option of running entirely from Google drive to vastly speed up the time it takes to start, it can take over 30Gb of Google Drive space if both default and custom models are used! However it changes subsequent startup times from 15-20 mins to 4-5 mins. <br>

## Install options
#### Run Directly from Github:
Open https://colab.research.google.com <br>
A box should popup asking what project you wish to open. If it does not, choose "File" > "Open Notebook" (Ctrl + O) <br>
Select "GitHub" from the top bar <br>
In the search box type this repos name "MikeEmmett/InvokeAI" <br>
Select the ".ipynb" file "InvokeAI_in_Google_Colab.ipynb" <br>
Optional: Choose "File" > "Save copy to drive". So you can re-open it quickly and allow it to save your configration.

---

#### Manually upload this file to your google drive:
Download "InvokeAI_in_Google_Colab.ipynb" (Click "Code" at the top > Choose "Download zip") After saving it, extract it.<br>
Upload it to your google drive.<br>
Then either launch it from https://drive.google.com OR https://colab.research.google.com - Google drive | Note: "apps" on either desktop or mobile will not work.

#### Manual setup in Google Colab:
To use this you need to create a google colab project, you can create one here, https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true <br>
Enable GPU on your Colab - Edit > Notebook Settings > Hardware accelerator > GPU <br>
Create 4 code boxes and copy / paste each section of "InvokeAI_in_Google_Colab.ipynb" into them, top to bottom.

#### Confirmed working for InvokeAI v2.3.5.post2 and V3.0.1 (V3 requires a workaround, stated in the project)
