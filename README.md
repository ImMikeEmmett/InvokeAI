# InvokeAI
### A Google Colab / InvokeAI project <br>
---
#### Simple Setup:
Download "InvokeAI_in_Google_Colab.ipynb" (Click "Code" at the top > Choose "Download zip") After saving it extract it.<br>
Upload it to your google drive.<br>
Then either launch it from https://drive.google.com OR https://colab.research.google.com - Google drive "apps" on either desktop or mobile will not work. 

---

#### Manual setup in Google Colab:
To use this you need to create a google colab project, you can create one here, https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true <br>
Enable GPU on your Colab - Edit > Notebook Settings > Hardware accelerator > GPU <br>
Create 4 code boxes and copy / paste each section into them, top to bottom.

#### Confirmed working for InvokeAI v2.3.5.post2 and V3.0.0+b6 (V3 requires a workaround stated in the project)
