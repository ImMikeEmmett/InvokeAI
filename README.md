# InvokeAI
### A Google Colab / InvokeAI project <br>

#### Open Directly from Github:
Open https://colab.research.google.com <br>
A box should popup asking what project you wish to open. If it does not, choose "File" > "Open Notebook" (Ctrl + O) <br>
Select "GitHub" from the top bar <br>
In the search box type this repos name "MikeEmmett/InvokeAI" <br>
Select the ".ipynb" file "InvokeAI_in_Google_Colab.ipynb" <br>
Optional: Choose "File" > "Save copy to drive". So you can re-open it quickly and to make it save your configration.

#### Manually upload this to your google drive:
Download "InvokeAI_in_Google_Colab.ipynb" (Click "Code" at the top > Choose "Download zip") After saving it, extract it.<br>
Upload it to your google drive.<br>
Then either launch it from https://drive.google.com OR https://colab.research.google.com - Google drive "apps" on either desktop or mobile will not work.

#### Manual setup in Google Colab:
To use this you need to create a google colab project, you can create one here, https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true <br>
Enable GPU on your Colab - Edit > Notebook Settings > Hardware accelerator > GPU <br>
Create 4 code boxes and copy / paste each section into them, top to bottom.

#### Confirmed working for InvokeAI v2.3.5.post2 and V3.0.0+b6 (V3 requires a workaround stated in the project)
